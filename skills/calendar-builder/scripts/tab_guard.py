"""Row guard for writes to the Ideas and Milestones tabs (calendar builder).

Usage:
  python3 tab_guard.py before.json fresh.json writes.json --key "Idea (one line)" [--config workspace.json]
  python3 tab_guard.py before.json fresh.json writes.json --key "Milestone" [--config workspace.json]

before.json: the tab (Ideas A1:H or Milestones A1:G) as read at the start of the run, saved exactly as
             returned ({"values": [[headers], [row2], ...]} or a bare list of rows).
fresh.json:  the same range read again just before writing, saved the same way.
writes.json: [{"row": 5, "col": "Status", "value": "Scheduled"}, ...]  (col is the header name)

Someone may delete, insert or sort rows on these tabs while a run is in progress. For each write the
script checks that, on that row, the key cell (the Idea text, or the Milestone name), the status cell
(Ideas Status, or Milestones Confirmed) and the target cell are the same in fresh.json as in
before.json. If they are, the write is accepted with its exact range. If not, every write on that row
is skipped (a row is written in full or not at all), with one plain line per row for the weekly brief
(for example a person set Declined or Cancelled during the run). The tab name comes from --key, so a
write can never land on the wrong tab. The builder writes only the accepted ranges.

Optional config: calendar.tabs in workspace.json renames the tabs or columns, for example
  {"ideas": {"tab": "Ideas", "key": "Idea (one line)", "status": "Status"},
   "milestones": {"tab": "Milestones", "key": "Milestone", "status": "Confirmed"}}
A missing key uses these defaults.

Prints {"accepted": [{"range", "value"}], "skipped": [{"row", "col", "reason"}], "brief_lines": [...]}.
Exit 0 if every write was accepted, 1 if anything was skipped, 2 on a usage or input error.
Writes nothing.
